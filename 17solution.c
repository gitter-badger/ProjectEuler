Problem 17
==========


   If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four,
   five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.

   If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written
   out in words, how many letters would be used?

   NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and
   forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains
   20 letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance
   with British usage.
