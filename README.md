# project-euler
The home of my (often feeble) attempts at [Project Euler] (https://projecteuler.net/) challenges.   This repo includes a cache of all Project Euler challenge questions for offline (i.e. long plane rides) access.  Big thanks to Kyle Keen's [Local Euler](http://kmkeen.com/local-euler) for making that possible.

After once through the normal Project Euler, I will move on to [ProjectEuler+ on HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges).  The challenges are basically the same but the test cases are hidden (and include edge case tests) and computation time is limited.  

### Languages
I tend to try first in C and then, once solved, move into a different language such as Java or Python.  As such, my final solutions are often quite... non-idiomatic.  Like, *really* not idiomatic at all. I have this horrible tendency to try to translate my methods "word for word" from C into other languages.  It's exactly as ineffective as it seems.  The struggle is real.

### Code Comments
I also have not bothered to comment most of these solutions although if I were particularly proud of one I may take the time to comment/narrate it thoroughly.
